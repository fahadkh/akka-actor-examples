# akka-actor-examples
Simple examples that explain the basics of akka actors, with some examples of what not to do.

Runnable files:

ActorApp: Simple single actor system. Prints some stuff.

ActorSystemApp: Creates an actor that creates it's own actor. Also prints stuff, but in a sketchy way.

BadActorApp: Creates a bad actor that does sketchy stuff with futures and refs.
